This small app uses solves the graph coloring problem using multiple methods:
1. Genetic Algorithms
2. Heuristcal DFS
3. Bad edges color classes
4. Kemp Chains color classes

The graphs used to test this application are taken from the DIAMCS graph coloring challenge: http://dimacs.rutgers.edu/archive/Challenges/
