# Practiacl AI

This Repo contains solved assignments for a lab course in Artificial Inteligence.

## Topics implemented:
- Genetic Algotithms.
- Informed Search Algorithms.
- Constraints Satisfaction Problems (CSP).

## Projects:

### [StringBuilder][1]
A genetic algorithm that inputs a target string and develops it from random via a heuristc iterative process.

### [RushHour][2]
This program solves Rush Hour puzzles.

### [KnapsackProblem][3]
This program solves the known knapsack problem (weighted).


### [NQueensProblem][4]

### [GraphColoring][5]
This program inputs a graph and outputs the chromatic number of that graph, meaning - the minimum amount of colors that can be used to color the graph so that no edge is made of two vertices of the same color.

The graphs used to test this application are taken from the DIAMCS graph coloring challenge: http://dimacs.rutgers.edu/archive/Challenges/
